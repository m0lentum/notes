[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space)

A Hilbert space is an [[inner product]] space
for which the induced [[metric]] space is [[Complete space|complete]].
This includes infinite-dimensional spaces.
All Hilbert spaces are [[Banach space]]s (complete normed spaces)
as the inner product induces a [[norm]].

Examples of infinite-dimensional spaces
include spaces of [[sequence]]s
and spaces of _square-integrable_ functions
(i.e. functions for which the integral $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(x)|^2dx$ is finite).
Not all function spaces are Hilbert spaces
due to the requirement of completeness.
