The winding number of a closed path $\gamma : [a, b] \rightarrow U \subset \mathbb{C}$ around point $z$
measures how many times the path "surrounds" $z$,
computed as
$$
n_{\gamma}(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{dw}{w - z}.
$$
The winding number is constant in each [[Connectedness|connected]] component
of $\mathbb{C} \setminus |\gamma|$, where $|\gamma|$ denotes the image of $\gamma$.

Every closed path divides the plane into components
such that exactly one of them is unbounded,
and in this unbounded component we always have $n_{\gamma} = 0$.

We can similarly compute the winding number of a [[cycle]]
as the sum of winding numbers of each path in the cycle.
