A conformal map is a map that preserves angles between curves.
It can be nonlinear, mapping lines to arbitrary curves,
in which case the angles are defined _locally_
as the angle between tangent vectors.

In dimensions 3 and above, all conformal maps
are [[MÃ¶bius map]]s.
On the other hand, in $\mathbb{C}$, any [[complex analytic function]]
that is also an [[injection]] is conformal.
Example: $z \mapsto z^2$ is conformal in the upper half-plane
(but not in the whole complex plane
because then it is no longer an injection)

### Theorem: preservation of harmonic maps

If $h : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a [[harmonic map]] (meaning its Laplacian is zero)
where $U \subset \mathbb{C}$, and $f : V \rightarrow U$ is conformal,
then $h \circ f$ is harmonic.
