A complex function $f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$
is _meromorphic_ in the open set $U$
if it is analytic everywhere except in a _discrete set_,
i.e. a set that does not have any _accumulation points_
(see [[Closure]], [[Topology]]).

Consequently, for any singularity $z_0$ of a meromorphic function,
there is a punctured disk $D_r^*(z_0)$ 
that does not contain any other singularities
and therefore $f$ is analytic there.

Meromorphic functions can be expressed as ratios of analytic functions
([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meromorphic_function))
and can be analyzed in the neighborhood of each singularity
by means of the [[Laurent series]].
