Let $U : D_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a [[harmonic map]] ($\Delta u = 0$)
from the complex unit disk to the reals.
Then the value of $u$ can be computed by
$$
u(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\partial D_1}
\frac{1 - |z|^2}{|w - z|^2} u(w)\,dw
$$
Combined with the _Riemann mapping theorem_:
If $U$ is an open [[simply connected set]],
there exists a bijective [[conformal map]]
between $U$ and the unit disk $D_1$,
this formula gives a way to compute values of a harmonic function
in any simply connected subset of the complex plane.
