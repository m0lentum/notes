(Homology in general is a broader but related concept ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics)));
this is what I've learned in complex analysis)

The homology of a [[cycle]] measures the (signed) number of times
that curves in the cycle wind around points not in the cycle's domain.
In terms of the complex [[winding number]] $n_{\sigma}$,
a cycle has homology $k$ in the set $U$
if $n_{\sigma}(z) = k$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus U$.

This is all we need for the global [[Cauchy's theorem]],
and thus all I know for now.

Here the paths have nonzero winding numbers around the holes in $U$
but they cancel out due to opposite directions.
