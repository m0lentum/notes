A cycle is a collection of _closed_ paths in a set $U$:
$\gamma_i : [a_i, b_i] \rightarrow U$ such that $\gamma_i(a_i) = \gamma_i(b_i)$,
denoted $\sigma = (\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \dots, \gamma_n)$.

The order of paths in a cycle can be changed without altering it,
but the direction the paths are traversed in cannot.

A single path is also a cycle.

Cycles can be integrated over just like paths,
and the integral over a cycle
is the sum of integrals over each individual path.

An important property of a cycle in complex analysis is its [[homology]],
which measures how many times it winds around points not in $U$.
In particular, the global [[Cauchy's theorem]]
states that integrals over zero-homologic cycles are zero.
