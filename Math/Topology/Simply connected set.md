Intuitively, a set is simply connected if it's [[Connectedness|connected]]
and doesn't have any "holes" in it.
Formally, a _domain_ (i.e. open, connected set) $U$
(I _think_ this is the correct translation for Finnish "alue")
is simply connected if every closed path has zero [[homology]].

Alternative characterizations in $\mathbb{C}$:
- with $U$ bounded, $U$ is simply connected $\iff$ $\mathbb{C} \setminus U$ is connected
- with $U$ unbounded, $U$ is simply connected $\iff$ all components of $\mathbb{C} \setminus U$ are unbounded
I'm not sure how general these statements are;
I don't think they're true for all topological spaces
but they probably apply to all vector spaces.
