Given two (smooth) paths $\gamma_0, \gamma_1 : [0, T] \rightarrow S$ with the same endpoints $p, q \in S$,
a _homotopy_ is a "smooth deformation" from one to the other.
Formally: a homotopy $\gamma$ between $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ is a smooth map
$\gamma : [0, 1] \times [0, T] \rightarrow S$
such that $\gamma(s, \cdot)$ is a smooth path from $p$ to $q$ for any $s \in [0, 1]$,
$\gamma(0, t) = \gamma_0(t)$, and $\gamma(1, t) = \gamma_1(t)$.
If this map exists, $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are _homotopic_.

A similar definition can be given for smooth surfaces
and higher-dimensional manifolds.
