A homomorphism is a map between [[group]]s
that commutes with the group operation.
$\rho : G \rightarrow H$, with $G, H$ being groups, is a homomorphism
if $\rho(gh) = \rho(g)\rho(h)$ for all $g,h \in G$.

This implies that $\rho(1) = 1$ (where 1 is the identity element of each group)
and $\rho(g^{-1}) = \rho(g)^{-1}$,

If a homomorphism is also a [[bijection]],
it's called an _isomorphism_.
