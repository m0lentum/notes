Relaxation methods are a class of iterative methods
for solving matrix equations
that iterate over the system "one row at a time" several times.
(not sure how they're actually defined,
but methods like that seem to be what people usually refer to with the term).

Methods in this category include successive over-relaxation (SOR)
and its special cases Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel.
