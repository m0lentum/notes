Direct methods solve a system of equations exactly
in one pass, without iterating the same process multiple times.
They are generally of $O(n^3)$ complexity.

Methods include forward/backward substitution (for triangular matrices),
Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, and Cholesky decomposition.

TODO: write down what each of the above does
