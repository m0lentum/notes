Given two [[vector space]]s $V, V'$ and chosen bases $\{e_i\},\{e'_j\}$,
their tensor product $V \otimes V'$ is the vector space 
with basis of the form $e_i \otimes e'_j$,
where $\otimes$ denotes pairing together basis vectors of $V$ and $V'$
(similar to [[direct sum]]).

The tensor product between vectors $v = v^ie_i, v' = v'^je'_j$
is defined as $v \otimes v' = v^iv'^j(e_i \otimes e'_j)$.

A downside of this definition is that it requires a basis.
There's a way to define the tensor product without a basis,
but I can't be bothered to write it down right now.
TODO: Needham (2021) has a better explanation of this
