The "total working time" system
doesn't have a set number of vacation days
(except it actually does, you just have to count them manually).

1612 hours per year / 7.25 hours per day
= 222.3 days per year

Weekdays aug-dec 2024: (52 - 31) * 5 + 2 + 2 = 109
Weekdays jan-jul 2025: 29 * 5 + 4 + 3 = 152
Total weekdays: 261
Vacation days: 39

Days spent: 7
Days left: 32
